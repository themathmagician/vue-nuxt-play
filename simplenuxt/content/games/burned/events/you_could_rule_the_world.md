It is time for their 1-1.
She wraps up her tasks, pick up the phone and heads over to find an undisturbed office.

- How is building?
- It is tough. Our internal customer is eating us alive. We waste so much time on meetings! And Jesper, he just floods my calendar with "talks". I feel, like I have to spend 2 hours every day, just explaining to him, what we are doing.
- Agata, Agata, are you fighting with people again?
- Agata, you could rule the world, if you were 10% better at not fighting with people. The only reason why Jesper is here, is because he can take care of the things you dont want to do, budget, and management presentations.

She likes processes, and to do things as usual. Sceptic to change, and political.
She doesnt like wizz kids, and cares more about her career than the outcome.

Seven people were dismissed from the team, two quit on their own after 2 weeks, one should be removed, 
but it is dragging on.

Jeanne has not shared the hiring information with the team, not a single time was Agata participating in a job interview.

Several new team members expressed anxiety - and confusion - as Jeanne gave them a different idea
of what the team was like vs the reality.

She suggested to Agata that it is all a political game, and not everyone plays to make a successful project,
but more to make themselves look successful.

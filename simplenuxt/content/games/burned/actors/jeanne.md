She likes processes, and to do things as usual. Sceptic to change, and political.
She doesnt like wizz kids, and cares more about her career than the outcome.

Seven people were dismissed from the team, two quit on their own after 2 weeks, one should be removed, 
but it is dragging on.

Jeanne has not shared the hiring information with the team, not a single time was Agata participating in a job interview.

Several new team members expressed anxiety - and confusion - as Jeanne gave them a different idea
of what the team was like vs the reality.

She suggested to Agata that it is all a political game, and not everyone plays to make a successful project,
but more to make themselves look successful.

- Not that *you* would think like this

Power hungry. 

Calendar meetings is like pissing off territory. She is agressive, when Agata sets her boundaries, like please don't overbook me.

No structured feedback about the team, Agata feels no support.

Several times, Agata has to console team members, confused after a meeting with her.

Jeanne is a supporter of the system. Of doing things like always.
This means a lot of time spent in meetings.

Sometimes, she is helpful.
Like, when she leads an official meeting with Sanne, and shields the team.
She is good at keeping meeting structures.
Unlike Jesper.
